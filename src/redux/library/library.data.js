    title: "The Purple Book",
    sinopsis: "In today's uncertain world, storms will arise that test your faith in a loving heavenly Father. At times, the winds and waves of the world's deceptions will roll in and seek to erode your confidence in God. Without a firm foundation in the truth of God's Word, you may be tempted to go off course and accept less than God's best for you. However, when you hear Jesus' words, receive them, and put them into practice, you will construct a life the torrents cannot shake, 'because it was well built' (Luke 6:48)."

    title: "Supernova Era",
    sinopsis: "Hugo Award winner Cixin Liu had the science fiction world spellbound with his Remembrance of Earth’s Past trilogy, but Supernova Era is something different.

    author: "Stephen King",
    title: "The Outsider",
    sinopsis: "Confession: while I’ve seen many of the movies and shows on which his novels are based, I’ve never actually read a Stephen King novel (sorry, Sarah Jane!). But the menacing and equally fascinating cover of King’s imposter-thriller THE OUTSIDER drew me in right away"
